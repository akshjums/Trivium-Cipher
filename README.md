# Trivium-Cipher
Trivium cipher algorithm was implemented in VHDL. The design was functionally simulated on Modelsim, to study the stream of bits generated by the design. These stream of bits were clubbed together in a specific manner to produce a stream of random numbers. The design was burnt on BASYS2 development board for verification.
